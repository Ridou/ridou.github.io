<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and
  paste it into your github.io site, but it will at
  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) -->

#### Full DBC Experience
#### 10/12/2014

1. I am really motivated to go through the whole DBC experience! 
I think they are very well organized and I am confident that it works. 
I believe that if I do all the work and use all the resources that they make accessible to me will make me a great developer. 
It is definitely a very busy and important part of my life because I am building the foundations of my practice.
I am very self aware and mindful of others and I believe this is one of the reasons I am able to engage and integrate with others in this program. 
I am hoping to stay up late and make the best out of this experience to learn as much as possible. 
These friends that I will make in DBC will be ones that I will share for the rest of my life.  
I hope they are all as passionate as I am to learn and become an awesome programmer. 
Instead of nervous I am anxious to every day learn something new and have the full DBC experience.
