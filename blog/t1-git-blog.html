  it will not render beautifully when you copy and

  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able
  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) -->

#### Version Control, Tracking Changes, Storing
#### 10/12/2014

I'm not accustumed to blogging because I am used to having an interactive conversation with people, so I will attempt it by acting like I am talking to my dog, which only responds with woof and woof woof. 

Version control is the most important feature when working within a team. You can track the changes of the work that everyone has done in the past or just see how the repository went from 0 to 100 real quick through as many commits through out the years. The most important part to assess is that if for some reason the earliest commit created a bug in which something stopped working, you can go back to the old stored commits and find the bug faster. So, don't worry about making a mistake because you can always go back to the previous saved state. You have yet to bark Luca, so I imagine you understood the importance of having version control.
